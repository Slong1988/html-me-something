        <p class="p1"> &quot; My journey begins with obesity, I was raised on the traditional Western Diet full of processed foods and unhealty fats, 
            and it took me a long time to realize the damage I was causing to my well being. So I sought out to do some research and 
            find a way to enjoy being healthy. &quot;
        </p>

      <div class="border">
          <p>The hardest part is sifting through all of the information available, just googling "healthy eating" returns around <b>625,000,000</b> results,
              and my best advice is to stick with what is comfortable and make small changes each week. Trying to go on a full plant based diet without
              going through the proper transitiong phase will just make you think of cheeseburgers every day. So do some research and pick a topic that 
              sparks your interest and delve into the lifestyle bit by bit.

          Being healthy seems life a fundamental concept that is easy to grasps, however the challenge is not the concept it is the action of following the 
          recomendations; eat mor vegatables, minimize dairy intake, cut out processsed and refined foods, oh and exercise a bunch more. Whew that was easy!
          I am by no means in great shape, but each day I try to make small strides in the direction of optimal health for me.

            That is perhaps the most important thing to remember, what is your optimal health? It does not being having a 6 pack and 4 % body fat, it means 
            begin comfortable and not getting winded just by regualr day to day task which will lead to better overall well being. There are so many diets 
            and fads that make it seem overwhelming, choose this don't do this pay for this... My best advice is chose foods that you will actually enjoy
            and over time incorpate a plant based food to replace the 'bad' stuff. Oh and for the bad stuff, just use your own judgement of how clean or
            healthy this product really is, and always use google!
