        <p>My journey begins with obesity, I was raised on the traditional Western Diet full of processed foods and unhealty fats, 
            and it took me a long time to realize the damage I was causing to my well being. So I sought out to do some research and 
            find a way to enjoy being healthy.

          <p>The hardest part is sifting through all of the information available, just googling "healthy eating" returns around 625,000,000 results,
              and my best advice is to stick with what is comfortable and make small changes each week. Trying to go on a full plant based diet without
              going through the proper transitiong phase will just make you think of cheeseburgers every day. So do some research and pick a topic that 
              sparks your interest and delve into the lifestyle bit by bit.
